## Inspiration
Waktu was inspired by a bad tendency to spend long periods of time sitting in front the computer. I wanted to take more breaks in order to combat my stiff neck muscles and fatigued eyes. Other screentime reminder apps were either too flashy or cost a fee, so Waktu arose as a minimalistic open-source application for this problem.
